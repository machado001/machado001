- Interested in working with Native Android Development.

- Currently, I'm developing a personal project using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** using MAD (modern android development) skills, as recommended by the official documentation. [Click here to see the repository's project.](https://github.com/machado001/hangman)

- While my current focus is on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, I wouldn't mind learning Java or the traditional Android View system with XML, should the need arise.
